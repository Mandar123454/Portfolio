# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this portfolio.

## Quick rules
- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Prefer accessibility and performance over heavy visuals.
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless they’re clearly justified.
- Never commit secrets (SMTP creds, API keys). Use `.env.local`.

## Local setup
```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Before opening a PR
- Run `npm run build`.
- Make sure routes still work on mobile.
- If you change UI, include screenshots.
