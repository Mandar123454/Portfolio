## Features
- Focused home section with a clear snapshot and a concise “What I do” summary
- In‑site lightviewer for certificates and evidence (mobile friendly), with ESC/overlay close, focus management, and scroll lock
- Internships: dual‑document viewer (Certificate and LOR) with animated top‑right Close; per‑card actions “View Internship Certificate” and “View LOR Certificate”
- Centered navigation with compact link pills and a subtle active glow; minimal footer with social links
- Contact pipeline: SMTP via Nodemailer (Brevo recommended), optional Google Sheet webhook, and Formspree fallback; per‑IP rate limit (5/min), honeypot, offline retry, and success toast
- Privacy‑respecting analytics (GA4) gated by consent
- Search optimization: filesystem‑generated sitemap, robots.txt, per‑page canonical URLs, and a stable metadataBase
- Analytics with consent: a banner gates GA4 loading; IP is anonymized; fully environment‑driven
- User experience details: one‑time preloader, lightweight micro‑interactions, desktop custom cursor, smooth scrolling, styled scrollbars
- Accessibility: dialogs use appropriate roles; keyboard and ESC support; a skip‑to‑content link is provided

## Pages and routes
- `/` Home: snapshot and “What I do.” Evidence chips open the image lightviewer
- `/certifications`: category tabs (Cybersecurity, Data Science, Other) with animated cards; click to view the certificate
- `/projects`: polished projects index with domain filters, summaries, "Watch Demo" modal, GitHub/Live links, and "Read Case Study" for each project
- `/projects/[slug]`: individual case study pages (video‑first) with sections: What it is, Key Features, How it works, How it was built, and Proof & Links
- `/internships`: online internships with roles, stacks, and highlights
	- Includes a lightviewer for Internship Certificate and LOR; open via the two buttons on each card
- `/contact`: SMTP‑backed form with validation and fallbacks
- `/about`: about page copy placeholder

## Architecture and technology
- Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for micro‑interactions
- Lucide icons
- Email: Nodemailer (SMTP), optional Apps Script webhook, and Formspree fallback
- Deployment: Netlify (with `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`) or Vercel

## Projects & demos
- Video‑first demos: All projects use a modal on the index page and a preview on case studies.
- Backend for videos: Unlisted YouTube videos embedded via privacy‑enhanced `youtube-nocookie.com` iframes. Audio is permanently muted via embed parameters.
- Posters: Derived from YouTube thumbnails (max‑res/sd/hq fallback) instead of shipping image binaries in the repo.
- Wire demos on index: update the DEMOS registry in [app/projects/SectionsClient.tsx](app/projects/SectionsClient.tsx). Each item uses `embedUrl` (YouTube‑nocookie) and an optional poster.
- Wire demos on case study: set the `video` field per project in [app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx](app/projects/%5Bslug%5D/page.tsx) with `{ provider: "youtube", id, embedUrl }`.
- Typed routes: internal links use Next `Link`; external links use `<a>` to satisfy typedRoutes.

### Important: Git + video assets
- No MP4 or large video binaries are committed to this repository.
- All demos are streamed from YouTube (Unlisted) using IDs stored in code; the repo remains source‑only.
- If you fork this project, upload your own demo videos to YouTube (Unlisted/Private) and update the ID mapping in [lib/youtube.ts](lib/youtube.ts).

## Getting started (development)
```powershell
cd "e:\Internships and Projects\MK Portfolio"
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

## Environment and contact setup
See `.env.example` for all variables.

Required (email):
- SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, CONTACT_TO_EMAIL

Optional (email):
- CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL, CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL

Optional (site and analytics):
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
- NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX



Brevo quick start:
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_brevo_username
SMTP_PASS=your_brevo_smtp_key
CONTACT_TO_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

Delivery flow
1. SMTP email
2. Fire‑and‑forget webhook to Google Sheet (if configured)
3. If email fails: log to Sheet (await)
4. If Sheet unavailable: Formspree fallback

Rate limiting and user experience
- 5 requests per minute per IP, with Retry‑After header and submit‑button cooldown
- Honeypot spam trap, offline retry, and a success toast

## Analytics and SEO
Analytics (GA4)
- Create a GA4 property and set NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID in `.env.local`.
- A consent banner appears on first visit; selecting Allow loads Google Analytics.
- Use the Realtime report in Google Analytics to verify events.

SEO (Search Console)
- Add your site in Google Search Console (domain or URL prefix) and verify ownership (DNS TXT preferred).
- Submit `https://your-domain.com/sitemap.xml`.
- Set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL in `.env.local` so canonical URLs, robots, and sitemap use your real domain.

For a concise checklist, see `remaining.md`.



## Customization notes
- Navbar links: `components/HeaderNav.tsx` (edit `links`)
- Footer icons: `components/Footer.tsx` (`public/icons/*.svg`)
- Certifications cards: `components/CertCard.tsx`
- Certifications tabs/animations: `app/certifications/SectionsClient.tsx`
- Global styles/cursor/scrollbar: `app/globals.css`
- Lightviewer modals: `components/ProofModal.tsx`, `app/certifications/CertModal.tsx`, and `app/internships/InternModal.tsx`
- Internships list and actions: `app/internships/SectionsClient.tsx`
- Internships data and document mapping: `app/internships/page.tsx` (set `certImage` and `lorImage` for each item to filenames in `public/`)


## Recent updates

- Internships: introduced dual Certificate/LOR viewer; card has two actions (“View Internship Certificate” and “View LOR Certificate”)
- Adjusted internship modal Close button to top‑right outside the image area to avoid overlap
- Refined internships page description to highlight cybersecurity, MERN, and data science outcomes
- Projects: built a complete listing with filters, summaries, GitHub/Live links, and a "Watch Demo" modal
- Case studies: added `/projects/[slug]` pages for all projects with video‑first evidence and clean sections
- Video workflow: local MP4s under `public/demos` or external embeds; accessible controls and focus management

## Build
```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy
Netlify (recommended):
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish: `.next`
- Plugin: `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`

Vercel works out of the box.

## Troubleshooting
- Stale chunk (ChunkLoadError) during local dev or right after deploy: the app includes a narrow auto‑reload handler to recover from rare stale assets. If you still see it, hard refresh, stop the dev server, clear `.next`, and restart.
